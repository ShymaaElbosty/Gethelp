        <h2 class="title">How To Deal With Anxiety</h2>
        <p>Talking to someone you trust about what's making you anxious could be a relief. It may be that just having someone listen to you and show they care can help in itself. If you aren't able to open up to someone close to you, you could call the Samaritans.</p><br>
        <p>Anxiety can make it really hard to stop worrying. You might have worries you can't control. Or you might feel like you need to keep worrying because it feels useful – or that bad things might happen if you stop.

            It can be helpful to try different ways of addressing these worries. For example, you could:
            
            Set aside a specific time to focus on your worries – so you can reassure yourself you haven't forgotten to think about them. Some people find it helps to set a timer.
            Write down your worries and keep them in a particular place – for example, you could write them in a notebook, or on pieces of paper you put in an envelope or jar.</p><br>
            <p>Try to get enough sleep. Sleep can give you the energy to cope with difficult feelings and experiences. See our page on coping with sleep problems for more information.
                Think about your diet. Eating regularly and keeping your blood sugar stable can make a difference to your mood and energy levels. See our page on food and mood for more information.
                Try to do some physical activity. Exercise can be really helpful for your mental wellbeing. See our pages on physical activity for more information.</p>

                    <p>In the context of OCD, are where a person generally suffers with obsessional thoughts that are repetitive, disturbing and often horrific and repugnant in nature, for example, thoughts of causing violent or sexual harm to loved ones which don't involve specific immediate compulsions these are called Intrusive Thoughts, and sometimes mistakenly referred to as 'Pure O'. However, the term is a little misleading like rumination above because everybody alive will have intrusive thoughts, of course it could be argued that everybody with OCD will have 'intrusive thoughts' i.e. their 'obsessions'. But in reality even people without OCD will and do have intrusive thoughts, which can be both negative or positive, the thought of winning the lottery is technically an intrusive thought, just a pleasant one. But from an OCD perspective it is generally assumed that the thoughts are both unpleasant and repetitive (constant) and it is generally accepted that when talking about OCD 'Intrusive Thoughts' it of the types listed below that can cover absolutely any subject, but the more common areas of OCD related concerns covers the following sub- categories:
                        Relationship Intrusive Thoughts
                        Sexual Intrusive Thoughts

        <h2 class="title">How To Deal With OCD </h2>
        <P>t's understandable to want to get rid of thoughts that you find distressing or worrying. But often, the more we try to get rid of a thought, the more it comes into our mind. It can start to feel like the thought is stuck in our head, no matter what we do.
            Try to remember that intrusive thoughts are very common. Some studies have estimated that we have over 6,000 thoughts a day. And most people report that they sometimes have thoughts that bother them. Or that they find confusing, shameful or frightening.
            Try to sit with the thoughts that come into your head, rather than trying to get rid of them or make them better.
            It may help to name the thoughts. For example, you could think or say to yourself "there’s that intrusive thought again" or "here’s that thought that makes me feel scared".
            Some people find that if they exaggerate or make fun of their intrusive thoughts, it can make the thought less powerful.
            Try a grounding object. Keep a small object with you to hold and focus on when you feel bothered by your thoughts. For example, you could use a stone, a fidget toy or a piece of fabric. OCD UK sell 'just a thought' wristbands and badges to help remind you not to give meaning to every thought.

                    <h3 >Reflective listening</h3>
                    <p>Reflective listening is a specific type of couples therapy that can be beneficial for partners who want to work on their communication skills. By being in a healthy, safe environment where each person takes a turn being an active listener, giving the other partner an opportunity to speak freely, communication can be greatly enhanced. Read our guide on communication exercises for couples to learn more. 

                        When we rephrase our statements using “I” phrases instead of “you” statements, a more productive conversation can be had. 
                        
                        For example, rather than saying “you hurt my feelings when you’re late,” you could express your feelings more productively by saying something more along the lines of “I feel hurt when you are late.”</p>

EFT can help identify destructive patterns in a relationship that begin to interfere with attachments, ultimately preventing two people from bonding. By focusing on those patterns and behaviors that create a disconnect in the relationship, two people can begin healing and bonding in a more positive manner.</p>

The approach is helpful when working towards a short-term relationship goal.

        <h2 class="title">HOw to deal with couple therapy</h2>
        <p>1. Go In With an Open Mind
            Although people are becoming more open about their mental health, you may notice yourself shaming or stigmatizing therapy or the marriage counseling process. Often, this happens when you hold onto rigid misconceptions.
            
            Stigmas people can have about going to therapy include:
            
            You and your partner should be able to work everything out on your own
            Couples counseling is only for couples on the brink of divorce (that’s what divorce counseling is for)
            Couples counseling is about deciding who is right or wrong
            Only “crazy” people go to therapy
            Try to be conscious of these misconceptions—they can be insidious and detrimental to your process. Instead, remind yourself that therapy is about growth, learning, and self-awareness. In many ways, it’s a gift for both you and your partner.
            
            Keep in mind that you may not agree with all of your therapist’s suggestions. That’s very normal, and that doesn’t mean the work isn’t worth it.</p><br>
            <p>2. Don’t Assume You Need to Be at Rock-Bottom
                Unfortunately, many couples wait until it’s too late to reach out for help. At that point, they may already be filing for divorce or reeling with a permanent sense of resentment in your marriage. While therapy might be able to reverse some of this damage, most professionals agree that you shouldn’t wait until things feel completely hopeless before starting treatment.
                
                It’s perfectly reasonable to reach out at any point during your relationship. For example, maybe you’re both struggling to support one another during a transitional period. Or, perhaps, you don’t like the way you two argue when faced with conflict.
                
                Furthermore, you don’t need to be married for a certain amount of years (or married at all!) to ask for help. In fact, many new couples seek therapy to learn how to build a healthy relationship foundation.</p><br>
                <p>3. Discuss Your Goals Together
                    This is one of the most important steps you can take for your marriage counseling to work well. Considering your couples therapy goals and objectives ahead of time allows you to make the most of the time you spend with your therapist.
                    
                    If you’re not sure about your goals, ask yourself if you’re facing these common struggles:1
                    
                    Difficulties with healthy communication
                    Sex or intimacy problems
                    Parenting disagreements
                    Financial stress
                    Significant life transitions (new job, marriage, baby, relocation, etc.)
                    Grief and loss
                    Infidelity
                    Any of these struggles can profoundly affect the safety and comfort needed in a supportive relationship. Think about your goals and write one or two of them down. It’s okay if you disagree on what you need to prioritize – your therapist will collaborate with both of you to determine an appropriate treatment plan.</p>

                    <p>In 2019, 301 million people were living with an anxiety disorder including 58 million children and adolescents (1).  Anxiety disorders are characterised by excessive fear and worry and related behavioural disturbances. Symptoms are severe enough to result in significant distress or significant impairment in functioning. There are several different kinds of anxiety disorders, such as: generalised anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive worry), panic disorder (characterised by panic attacks), social anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive fear and worry in social situations), separation anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive fear or anxiety about separation from those individuals to whom the person has a deep emotional bond), and others. Effective psychological treatment exists, and depending on the age and severity, medication may also be considered.</p>

                    <p>In 2019, 14 million people experienced eating disorders including almost 3 million children and adolescents (1). Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, involve abnormal eating and preoccupation with food as well as prominent body weight and shape concerns. The symptoms or behaviours result in significant risk or damage to health, significant distress, or significant impairment of functioning. Anorexia nervosa often has its onset during adolescence or early adulthood and is associated with premature death due to medical complications or suicide.  Individuals with bulimia nervosa are at a significantly increased risk for substance use, suicidality, and health complications. Effective treatment options exist, including family-based treatment and cognitive-based therapy.</p>

        <h2 class="title">How to deal with mood disorder</h2>
        <p>Talk to your doctor. “If your mood swings become harder and harder to deal with, it might be time to talk to your primary care physician and see what they recommend. There is help out there for you,” says Amonett. It’s important to go to your doctor to rule out anything physical that might be going on.</p><br>
        <p>Therapy. Once the physical aspect has been ruled out, consider seeking treatment to help you through your mental health struggles. Treatment through therapy is another useful tool to learn better coping skills and ways to process the emotions that you experience through your mood swings.</p><br>
        <p>Social Support. Staying socially engaged with friends and family is extremely important. Try to avoid isolation and stay in contact with a trusted individual. Having these connections will make it easier when you find yourself more likely to get depressed or anxious.</p>
